# Medical Chatbot using Llama2

## Overview

This project implements a medical chatbot using Streamlit for the user interface and LangChain for natural language processing (NLP) capabilities. The chatbot aims to provide information and answer questions related to various medical conditions and treatments based on a predefined knowledge base.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Users can interact with the chatbot in a conversational manner.
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Utilizes LangChain for retrieving information from a structured knowledge base.
- **Persistent Chat History**: Maintains a session-based chat history for a seamless user experience across interactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: Web application framework used for building the chat interface.
- **LangChain**: Library for handling natural language processing tasks, including retrieval-based question answering.
- **Python Libraries**: Various Python libraries such as Flask, Pinecone Client, and others for backend processing and integration.
- **Pinecone**: Used for vector storage and retrieval in the knowledge base setup.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanskarmodi8/medical_chatbot.git
   cd medical_chatbot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and create a virtual environment:
